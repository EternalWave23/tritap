TriTap

This project contains modified Cyanogenmod (https://download.cyanogenmod.org/) kernel source code for an LG Nexus 5 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5) smartphone. The modifications alter the touchscreen driver so that it logs the raw capacitive image to a proc file that is accessible to regular apps running on the phone. The system updates at between 25Hz (full sensor) and 33Hz (top 8 rows of the sensor). 

Sample applications written in Processing (https://processing.org/) show how to access the touch image data.
